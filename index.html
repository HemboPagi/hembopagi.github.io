      <h2>Estonian national costumes</h2>
      <p>
        Estonian national costume website is my first experience with
        React/Next.js. Initial Next.js functionality was written by other
        developer, my task was to build user interfaces. Now, after one year the
        site was launched I can see many things what could be done differently.
        Website uses IIP image server for saving high-quality zoomable images.
        This website is also one of very few in Estonia which serves all the
        images based on <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF standard</a>. This means,
        that all the images (which is the main focus of the website) with
        metadata can be viewed and queried by
        <a
          href="https://projectmirador.org/embed/?iiif-content=https://cms.rahvaroivad.ee/wp-json/iiif/manifest/gallery/172"
          >third-party systems</a
        >.

      <h2>Ackermann research project</h2>
      <p>
        The Ackermann project involved the documentation and conservation of
        wooden sculptures by Christian Ackermann in different churches in
        Estonia. In addition to the recording of the wooden sculptures that we
        have completed, we built a web/mobile website, as well as kiosk setup
        for the church.

      <h2>New Forest Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        In this project we have created a simple to use website that contains a
        great level of complexity. It draws together over 20 different types of
        data sources from external bodies, into one manageable system providing
        users with access to a wealth of knowledge about the New Forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        It includes a web mapping system, a data aggregator and an advanced
        search functionality plus many various bespoke interactive tools which
        adds a level of usability to the site that other similar systems are
        unable to provide.

      <h2>Google Chrome extension</h2>

      <p>
        This is a bit different project as stuff above. Here my idea was to
        speed up the processes in the museum by "hacking" the Estonian Museum
        Information System (MuIS). What I did was the extension for Google
        Chrome to extend the functionality of MuIS, so that different tasks and
        queries could be made using barcode scanner. This simple thing helps to
        save weeks or with the bigger collection in bigger organisations even
        months of working time.
