      <h2>Digital Livonia</h2>
      <em>Year completed: work in progess</em>
      <p>
        Digital Livonia (DL) is a research project led by Tallinn University,
        aimed at consolidating all digital resources related to medieval
        Livonia. My role in this project is to develop a web system that
        integrates these resources into one accessible platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been responsible for the architecture of the system, which
        includes using technologies like Next.js, Directus, and Kubernetes. I
        collaborate with two other developers who focus on creating functional
        components, while my primary task is to design the UI and integrate all
        the various elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project has pushed me to learn new technologies, such as
        Kubernetes, and how to set up infrastructure from scratch. It has also
        emphasized the importance of documentation and effective communication.
      </p>

      <p>The project and website are still in development.</p>

      <h2>Estonian national costumes</h2>
      <em>Year completed: 2020</em>
      <p>
        The Estonian National Costume website was my first experience working
        with React and Next.js. Although the initial Next.js setup was created
        by another developer, my primary responsibility was designing and
        building the user interfaces. Now, a year after its launch, I can see
        various aspects that could be improved or done differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site utilizes an IIP Image Server to deliver high-quality, zoomable
        images and is one of the few in Estonia to serve images according to the
        <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF standard</a>. This setup allows all
        images—one of the site’s main features—along with their metadata, to be
        viewed and queried through

      <h2>Ackermann research project</h2>
      <em>Year completed: 2017</em>
      <p>
        The Ackermann project focused on documenting and conserving wooden
        sculptures by Christian Ackermann, located in various churches across
        Estonia. In addition to completing the documentation of these
        sculptures, we also developed a web and mobile website, as well as an
        interactive kiosk system for use in the churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, I served as both the technical project manager and the
        frontend developer.

      <h2>New Forest Knowledge</h2>
      <em>Year completed: 2016</em>
      <p>
        In this project, we developed a user-friendly website that integrates a
        high level of complexity. The site consolidates over 20 different data
        sources from external organizations into one cohesive and manageable
        system, giving users access to a vast amount of information about the
        New Forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key features include a web mapping system, a data aggregator, advanced
        search functionality, and several custom interactive tools that enhance
        the usability of the site, setting it apart from other similar
        platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the technology behind this project is now somewhat outdated,
        the system is still actively maintained and remains in use,
        demonstrating its enduring value and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role in this project was both technical project manager and frontend
        developer.
